{% capture instructions %}
1. **Marinate the chicken:** In a large bowl, combine all marinade ingredients. Add chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, preferably 2-4 hours or overnight.

2. **Cook the chicken:** Preheat your broiler or grill to high heat. Thread chicken onto skewers or place on a baking sheet. Cook for 12-15 minutes, turning once, until chicken is charred in spots and cooked through. Set aside.

3. **Start the sauce:** In a large pan or Dutch oven, melt ghee over medium heat. Add onions and cook until softened and golden, about 8-10 minutes.

4. **Add aromatics:** Add garlic and ginger, cook for 2 minutes until fragrant. Add garam masala, coriander, cumin, and turmeric. Stir constantly for 1 minute to toast the spices.

5. **Build the sauce:** Add crushed tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. The mixture should darken and become very fragrant.

6. **Finish the sauce:** Lower heat and add cream, water/broth, sugar, and salt. Simmer gently for 10-15 minutes until sauce thickens. Do not boil or the cream may curdle.

7. **Combine:** Add the cooked chicken to the sauce. Simmer for 5-10 minutes to heat through and allow flavors to meld.

8. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with basmati rice, naan bread, or both!
