{% capture ingredients %}
- 6 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/3 cups mascarpone cheese (room temperature)
- 1 3/4 cups heavy cream

{% capture instructions %}
1. **Make the zabaglione:** In a double boiler, whisk egg yolks and sugar together until thick and pale (about 5 minutes). The mixture should fall in ribbons when you lift the whisk.

2. **Cool the mixture:** Remove from heat and whisk until cooled to room temperature.

3. **Add mascarpone:** Gently fold in the mascarpone until completely smooth.

4. **Whip the cream:** In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks.

5. **Combine:** Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. Set aside.

6. **Prepare coffee mixture:** Combine espresso and coffee liqueur (if using) in a shallow dish.

7. **Assemble first layer:** Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the coffee mixture and arrange in a 9x13 inch dish. Don't oversoak - a quick dip is enough!

8. **Add cream layer:** Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.

9. **Repeat:** Create another layer of dipped ladyfingers and top with remaining mascarpone mixture.

10. **Chill:** Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

11. **Serve:** Before serving, dust with cocoa powder and add chocolate shavings if desired.

{% capture alternatives %}
- **Mascarpone:** Mix 8 oz cream cheese + 1/4 cup heavy cream + 2 tbsp sour cream
- **Ladyfingers:** Sponge cake or pound cake cut into strips
- **Coffee liqueur:** Use rum, brandy, or just extra espresso
- **For alcohol-free:** Omit liqueur and add 1 tsp vanilla to coffee
- **Egg-free version:** Use 2 cups heavy cream whipped with 1/2 cup powdered sugar instead of zabaglione

{% capture notes %}
- Must be made ahead - needs at least 4 hours to set, overnight is best
- Traditional recipe uses raw eggs - use pasteurized if concerned
- Don't oversoak the ladyfingers or it will be soggy
- Keeps for 2-3 days covered in the refrigerator
- Cannot be frozen - texture will be ruined
- The name means "pick me up" in Italian, referring to the coffee
- Some regions in Italy add a thin layer of chocolate between layers
