{% capture ingredients %}
- 2 cups white cornmeal (fine or medium grind)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1½ cups buttermilk
- 4 tablespoons bacon drippings or vegetable oil, divided
{% endcapture %}

{% capture instructions %}
1. Place a 10-inch cast iron skillet in the oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C). This is crucial for the crispy crust.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.

3. In a separate bowl, combine the beaten egg and buttermilk.

4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients along with 3 tablespoons of the bacon drippings. Stir just until combined - don't overmix. The batter will be somewhat thin.

5. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of drippings to the skillet and swirl to coat the bottom and sides.

6. Pour the batter into the hot skillet - it should sizzle immediately. This creates the signature crispy crust.

7. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

8. Let cool in the skillet for 5 minutes before cutting into wedges. Serve warm with butter, honey, or alongside beans and greens.

{% capture alternatives %}
- **Bacon drippings:** Vegetable oil, melted butter, or lard all work
- **Buttermilk:** Mix 1½ cups regular milk with 1½ tablespoons vinegar or lemon juice, let sit 5 minutes
- **White cornmeal:** Yellow cornmeal works too, just different flavor
- **Cast iron skillet:** Use a 9-inch square baking pan, but you'll lose the crispy crust

{% capture notes %}
- This is authentic Southern cornbread - no sugar! The corn should be the star
- The hot skillet is non-negotiable for proper crust formation
- Leftover cornbread is perfect for making cornbread dressing
- My grandmother always said: "If you want cake, make cake. This is cornbread!"
- Best eaten within 2 days, or freeze for up to 1 month
- For "hot water cornbread" (hoecakes), thin the batter with hot water and fry in oil
